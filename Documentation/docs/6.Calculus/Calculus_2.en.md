### Integrals

$$
f(x) = \int\limits_a^x f(t) dt
$$

Plug x in for t

$$
f(x) = \int\limits_x^a f(t) dt
$$

Reverse limits of integration and multiply by -1, then plug x in for t.

$$
f(x) = \int\limits_a^{g(x)} f(t) dt
$$

Plug g(x) in for t, then multiply by dg | dx

$$
f(x) = \int\limits_{g(x)}^{a} f(t) dt
$$

Reverse limits of integration and multiply by -1, then plug(x) in for t and multiply by dg | dx.

$$
f(x) = \int\limits_{g(x)}^{h(x)} f(t) dt
$$

Split the limits of integration.

Reverse limits of integration and multiply by -1, then plug g(x) and h(x) in for t, multplying by dg|dx and dh/dx respectively
